This contract is a shared account which allows its members to make payments
using the available balance. An event is emitted whenever someone uses the
account to make a payment, allowing the other members to keep track of what is
spent.

Potential use cases:
  - A company giving its employees a way to pay for work-related expenses
  - A joint account for a couple
  - A family account to give children an allowance
